      "description": "Yuu is Chihaya's late younger brother, who passed away in a traffic accident some time before the start of the series The iDOLM@STER.  His death weighs heavily on Chihaya, and is implied to be a factor that strained relations in her family.  Chihaya fondly remembers his enjoying her singing, and telling her to sing more as he doodled in a sketchbook.  She keeps a photo of herself with her brother, taken when they were young.",
