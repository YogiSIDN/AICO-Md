      "description": "__Height:__ 158 cm\n\nA member of the Student Council and she is known as the girlfriend of Kakeru Sengoku who attends Katagiri Senior High School where she is enrolled in class 3-5. She is more of a mascot in the student council, and is shown to do little to no work at all. \n\nRemi is usually shown as a rather childish and immature girl who has a very straightforward personality, and often wears her emotions on her sleeve. And seems to rely on other people's help. She's also not very smart, often compared to Miyamura about which one is more of an idiot.\n\nShe loves insects, though she's bad with dragonflies. Her room is filled with her insect collection, and she has been nicknamed the Insect Queen. She also enjoys reading, especially fairy tales. She's also comically bad at cooking, just like Kakeru Sengoku. ",
