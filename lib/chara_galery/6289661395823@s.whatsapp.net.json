      "description": "__Height:__ 164 cm (5'3\")\n\nMarin Kitagawa is the main female protagonist in the _Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru_ series. \n\n~!Marin realizes she is in love with Wakana, and throughout the series, continually does whatever she can to invite him to places and spend time with him.!~\n\n<b>APPEARANCE</b>\nMarin Kitagawa is a slim and above average height girl  with dark pink colored contacts in her eyes and light skin. Her build is on the thinner side with a small waistline. She has silky blonde hair, tipped with pinkish-red or citrus orange, reaching down around her pelvic region. Her bangs cover a majority of her forehead and eyebrows, reaching around the start of her eyelashes. Two locks of hair also flow over her shoulders and end around her chest region. Her hairstyles include long straight hair, a single ponytail, a double ponytail, a double knot on top, a bun, and a single top ponytail. In terms of gradient, her hair goes from pure blonde at the top and progressively becomes pinkish-red or citrus-orange towards the bottom. She does wear ear piercings which include one ring piercing, three pearl piercings, and an industrial piercing on the left ear and two ring piercings and one pearl piercing on the right ear.\nIn fashion sense, it varies according to where she is. At school, she wears a white button shirt with one chest pocket on her left, a navy blue tie, a plaid skirt, black socks, and brown shoes. She also tends to wear a stretchy black choker, two bracelets on her left arm, and a ring on both her right pinky and left index finger. When she is going somewhere casual, she tends to wear various outfits that fit her liking.\nShe cosplayed as:\n~!1. Shizuku Kuroe;\n2. Black Lobelia;\n3. Prisoner Veronica;\n4. Rizu-kyun;\n5. Rei-sama.!~\n\n<b>PERSONALITY</b>\nMarin is a extravagant, messy, and while quite mature, she's also clumsy. She isn't very skilled at handiwork. Marin is a cosplayer and a huge otaku, being a fan of magical girl anime and adult video games. \nShe is very kind, friendly, cheerful and outgoing. She loves eating but still despite that she manages to maintain her slender figure.\n\n\n~!Marin blushes around Wakana if he says anything to compliment her, and admires his passion to do what he loves. She can also get frustrated with Wakana when he outright denies any rumor that the two are dating, given that Wakana thinks that she would never date someone like him (unknowing to her), leaving her upset. It's clear that just being around him makes her happy, and she's never once denied a rumor or disliked the idea that they're together, clearly hinting that she wants more in their friendship.!~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 160 cm (5'3\")\n__Occupation:__ Jujutsu Sorcerer, Student\n__Affiliation:__ Tokyo Jujutsu High\n__Grade:__ Grade 3 Sorcerer\n\nShe is a first-year student and grade 3 jujutsu sorcerer at Tokyo Jujutsu High studying under Satoru Gojo alongside Yuji and Megumi.\n \nNobara is a confident and brash young woman with an unshakable character. More than anything, Nobara is determined to stay true to herself no matter what. She takes great pride in being both a pretty girl and a strong fighter, refusing to let anyone influence her.\n\nInitially, Nobara can appear to be a very obnoxious and arrogant person. She first introduced herself to Yuji and Megumi by expressing how inferior they were. She also argued with Yuji for the greater part of their first mission together. Despite her abrasive attitude, Nobara is actually an incredibly caring and dutiful person, but would never let most people see that side of her. After fighting alongside each other in several missions, Yuji and Megumi grow to become Nobara's closest allies.\n\n\n",
