      "description": "__Height:__ 160 cm\n \nMio is a shy girl who is in the light music club. She plays a left-handed Fender Japan '62 Reissue Jazz Bass in 3-Tone Sunburst In the manga, she also has a left-handed, 3-Color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard, though is shown playing a Fender Precision Bass in the first manga volume. She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name Elizabeth later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu is involved; her weakness is the macabre and horrific, and she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also has a fear of being in the spotlight and gets embarrassed easily, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials.  Along with Yui, Mio is one of the band's main vocalists, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like \"Light and Fluffy Time\". As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments, because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play. Mio comes to greatly enjoy her time at university as she encounters many new experiences. She is also able to overcome some of her shyness and make new friends such as Sachi and Ayame. Her favourite food is Gateau au Chocolat (Rich Layered Chocolate Cake).",

Unlike her older sister, Ui is mature, responsible and handles household chores well, though she still shares a strong relationship with [Yui](https://anilist.co/character/19565/Yui-Hirasawa) and has a great deal of love and respect for her older sister. Despite being a year younger than [Yui](https://anilist.co/character/19565/Yui-Hirasawa), she is nearly identical to her with her hair down and is even once able to fool the club. She possesses some of her sister's musical gift, and has a great talent for playing the guitar—she became capable of playing with the rest of the light music club band after only a few days of practice ([Yui](https://anilist.co/character/19565/Yui-Hirasawa) was sick, so Ui dressed up as [Yui](https://anilist.co/character/19565/Yui-Hirasawa) to help the band out). She takes particularly good care of [Yui](https://anilist.co/character/19565/Yui-Hirasawa) and strives to look after her even at the risk of her own health. Ui is actually considered as the ultimate groupie for her sister's band and supports them with all her heart. She occasionally provides a narrative to the story. She is in the same class as [Azusa](https://anilist.co/character/21173/Azusa-Nakano) and hangs out with her sometimes. \n\n~!In the movie, she will play the keyboard altogether with [Azusa](https://anilist.co/character/21173/Azusa-Nakano) and [Jun](https://anilist.co/character/31526/Jun-Suzuki).!~",

      "description": "__Height:__ 160 cm\n \nMio is a shy girl who is in the light music club. She plays a left-handed Fender Japan '62 Reissue Jazz Bass in 3-Tone Sunburst In the manga, she also has a left-handed, 3-Color Sunburst Fender Jazz Bass with a tortoiseshell pickguard, though is shown playing a Fender Precision Bass in the first manga volume. She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name Elizabeth later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu is involved; her weakness is the macabre and horrific, and she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also has a fear of being in the spotlight and gets embarrassed easily, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials.  Along with Yui, Mio is one of the band's main vocalists, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like \"Light and Fluffy Time\". As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments, because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play. Mio comes to greatly enjoy her time at university as she encounters many new experiences. She is also able to overcome some of her shyness and make new friends such as Sachi and Ayame. Her favourite food is Gateau au Chocolat (Rich Layered Chocolate Cake).",

      "description": "[Kazuto](https://anilist.co/character/36765)'s sister in the real world. She is 15 years old and in her third year of junior high, as well as a member of the Kendou club. She's a diligent worker and has been practicing Kendou for 8 years.    ~!In the VRMMO game *Alfheim Online*, she is known as Leafa, a Sylph fairy. She stumbled onto Kazuto by accident one night and decided to travel with him to the World Tree. She eventually fell in love with him because he showed that he really loves playing VR games as if living in it and is very honest in everything. In the real world she slowly got closer to her brother (actually a cousin) but because they're family and because he already got [Asuna](https://anilist.co/character/36828) as a girlfriend she decided to give up on him and fall in love with Kazuto instead. But soon afterwards she realized that they're the same person. After being convinced by Kazuto to have a fierce duel which ended up in them flying in each others' arms, she decided to help Kazuto in rescuing Asuna.!~",

He and Kirito later separate because he has friends who were also new to the game so he couldn't leave them. He survives for the past two years and managed to protect his friends the whole time, something Kirito regretted not doing. He is a katana user and the leader of the small guild Fuurinkazan who participates in the boss battles.  As one of the few people close to Kirito, he always keeps him in check and wants Kirito to survive the game.  He chose the Salamader race on ALO   \n\n~! In the side story Caliber, he fell in love at first sight with the girl on the cage named Freyja and agreed that he will help her find her tribe's treasure which is a hammer, though the decision still remains to be a team's decision. The team said yes on Caliber and it turned out that the girl they saved was Thor. It was revealed that Thor disguised as a beautiful girl to get close to Giant King Þrym and retrieve his hammer.

      "description": "__Height:__ 164 cm (5'3\")\n\nMarin Kitagawa is the main female protagonist in the _Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru_ series. \n\n~!Marin realizes she is in love with Wakana, and throughout the series, continually does whatever she can to invite him to places and spend time with him.!~\n\n<b>APPEARANCE</b>\nMarin Kitagawa is a slim and above average height girl  with dark pink colored contacts in her eyes and light skin. Her build is on the thinner side with a small waistline. She has silky blonde hair, tipped with pinkish-red or citrus orange, reaching down around her pelvic region. Her bangs cover a majority of her forehead and eyebrows, reaching around the start of her eyelashes. Two locks of hair also flow over her shoulders and end around her chest region. Her hairstyles include long straight hair, a single ponytail, a double ponytail, a double knot on top, a bun, and a single top ponytail. In terms of gradient, her hair goes from pure blonde at the top and progressively becomes pinkish-red or citrus-orange towards the bottom. She does wear ear piercings which include one ring piercing, three pearl piercings, and an industrial piercing on the left ear and two ring piercings and one pearl piercing on the right ear.\nIn fashion sense, it varies according to where she is. At school, she wears a white button shirt with one chest pocket on her left, a navy blue tie, a plaid skirt, black socks, and brown shoes. She also tends to wear a stretchy black choker, two bracelets on her left arm, and a ring on both her right pinky and left index finger. When she is going somewhere casual, she tends to wear various outfits that fit her liking.\nShe cosplayed as:\n~!1. Shizuku Kuroe;\n2. Black Lobelia;\n3. Prisoner Veronica;\n4. Rizu-kyun;\n5. Rei-sama.!~\n\n<b>PERSONALITY</b>\nMarin is a extravagant, messy, and while quite mature, she's also clumsy. She isn't very skilled at handiwork. Marin is a cosplayer and a huge otaku, being a fan of magical girl anime and adult video games. \nShe is very kind, friendly, cheerful and outgoing. She loves eating but still despite that she manages to maintain her slender figure.\n\n\n~!Marin blushes around Wakana if he says anything to compliment her, and admires his passion to do what he loves. She can also get frustrated with Wakana when he outright denies any rumor that the two are dating, given that Wakana thinks that she would never date someone like him (unknowing to her), leaving her upset. It's clear that just being around him makes her happy, and she's never once denied a rumor or disliked the idea that they're together, clearly hinting that she wants more in their friendship.!~",

      "description": "Stella Vermillion is an A-rank Apprentice Knight and princess of the Vermillion Kingdom. She is a young girl with long vermilion hair tied in twintails and crimson eyes, average height and has large breasts and a voluptuous figure.\n\nStella initially appears to be feisty, hot-blooded, and quick to anger possibly due to her sheltered upbringing. However, later she is shown to be anything but bitter, and is even willing to admit her mistakes and be friendly with others. Despite this, she exhibits frequent bouts of jealousy especially when it comes to Ikki.\n\nStella gets agitated whenever anyone says that she is strong because she is an \"A Rank\" and do not see all her hard work, but Ikki Kurogane was the only one to see Stella's hard work which was one of the reasons Stella started developing feelings for him.\n\n(Source: Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry Wikia)",

Her hobbies are visiting and relaxing in onsen. She's also is a huge fan of lame puns and can continue for hours with this if the Producer can’t stop it. She can instantly smell the difference between body wash and shampoo products, has heterochromia, and has a beauty mark under her right eye.\n\nOnce Kaede has had a few drinks, all of her common sense goes out the window. She gains a devious and manipulative persona when intoxicated. She will push aside any notion to quit drinking and is not above encouraging the teenage idols to drink with her. She loves to enjoy expensive or really tasty drinks, particularly wines.\n\nWhile her everyday speaking voice is soft and quiet, her singing voice is powerful and resonant.",
